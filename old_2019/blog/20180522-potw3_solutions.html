            POTWs 3 Solutions
          </h1>
          <p>
						<em> 22 May 2018 </em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Here are the solutions to POTWs 3. Along with the solutions, we also give some comments and difficulty ratings $\beta$ in $[1,5]$, where POSN Camp level is 1-2, TMO level is 1-3, October Camp is around 2-4, and IMO is around 3-5.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>E3 </strong>[adapted from IMO 2006 P4] ($\beta = 1.5$)
						Show that for all primes $p>3$, $2^{p-2}+3^{p-2}+6^{p-2}-1$ is divisible by $p$.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Solution. </strong> Since $p>3$, we have $\gcd (p,2)=\gcd (p,3)=1$. Fermat's Little Theorem says $a^{p-1} \equiv 1\pmod{p}$, hence $a^{p-2}\equiv \frac{1}{a} \pmod{p}$ for all $a\in \{ 2,3,6\}$. Therefore
					</p>
					<p>
						$$2^{p-2}+3^{p-2}+6^{p-2}\equiv \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{6}=1\pmod{p}\quad \blacksquare $$
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Comment. </strong>This problem is an example of using fractions in modulo a prime $p$, which is often overlooked.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>M3 </strong>[Bulgaria TST 2005] ($\beta=3.4$)
						Find the number of the subsets $B$ of the set $\{ 1,2,...,2005\}$ such that the sum of the elements of $B$ is congruent to $2006$ modulo $2048$.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Solution.</strong> We claim that the answer is $2^{1994}$. First, define $S = \{1,2,\ldots, 2005\} \setminus \{2^0,2^1,\ldots ,2^{10}\}$. The key observation is that: for whatever subset $B'$ of $S$ selected (including the empty one), there is a unique set $B$ formed by $B'$ and a subset of $\{ 2^0,2^1,\ldots ,2^{10} \}$ such that the sum of elements of $B$ is congruent to $2006$ modulo $2048$. (This is because we can uniquely create sums $0,1,2,...,2047$ from $2^{11}$ subsets of $\{2^0,2^1,\ldots ,2^{10}\}$.) Hence, the number of subsets $B$ satisfying the condition is equal to the number of subsets of $S$, which is equal to $2^{2005-11}. \quad \blacksquare$
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Comment.</strong> This problem is a bit tricky. The main point is that you can control the sum by looking at only powers of two; the rest is easy. We believe this is the only way to easily find the answer.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>H3 </strong>[reddit] ($\beta=4.1$)
					</p>
					<p>
						From any pair of positive integers $(a,b)$, in each turn, you can choose to move to either $(a+1,2b)$ or $(2a,b+1)$. Show that, starting from any pair of positive integers $(m,n)$, you can reach a pair of two equal positive integers.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Solution. </strong>[@Lopsidation on reddit] First, call the moves $(a,b)\rightarrow (a+1,2b)$ and $(a,b)\rightarrow (2a,b+1)$ operation $1$ and $2$, respectively. Call the pair of positive integers $(x,2^dx+k)$ belong to type $(d,k)$ for non-negative integer $d$ and integer $k$. It suffices to show that, for any positive integer $k$, starting from any pair of type $(0,k)$ where $k$ is a positive integer, we can move to a pair of type $(0,m)$ for some $-k< m< k$ (remark: since our operation is symmetric in variables $a,b$, we may swap the rest of the operation sequence we intended to use with $(x,y)$ and say we'll start from $(y,x)$ instead; this results in our assumptions $k>0$ and $-k< m< k$.)
					</p>
					<p>
						Note that the operation $1$ change the pair of type $(d,k)$ to a pair of type $(d-1,k+1)$ and operation $2$ change from $(d,k)$ to $(d+1,2k-2^{d+1})$.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to do that, we use the following sequence of types of pair we obtain from the moves:
					</p>
					<p>
						$$(0,k)\rightarrow_2 (1,2^1k-1\times 2^1)\rightarrow_2 (2,2^2k-2\times 2^2)\rightarrow_2 \ldots \rightarrow_2 (k,2^{k}k-k\times 2^{k})=\\(k,0)\rightarrow_{1} (k-1,1) \rightarrow_1 (k-2,2)\rightarrow_1 \ldots \rightarrow_1 (\ell -1,k-\ell +1) \rightarrow_2 \\ (\ell ,2k-2^{\ell} -2\ell+2) \rightarrow_1 (\ell -1,2k-2^{\ell}-2\ell +3)\rightarrow_1 \ldots \rightarrow_1 (0,2k-2^{\ell}-\ell +2).$$
					</p>
					<p>
						Note that in the above sequence, $\ell$ can be any positive integer not greater than $k$. So, we are done if there exists an $\ell$ satisfying $-k< 2k-2^{\ell}-\ell +2< k$; this is equivalent to $k< 2^{\ell} +\ell -2< 3k$.
					</p>
					<p>
						For each positive integer $\ell$, let $f(\ell )=2^{\ell} +\ell -2$. Note that $f(k)>k$ for all $k\geq 2$ and $\frac{f(i+1)}{f(i)} \leqslant 3$ for all $i\geq 2$. Hence we are done if $3k\geqslant f(2)=4$ by repeatedly adding $1$ to $\ell$ (starting from $\ell=2$) until we get one satisfying the bound.
					</p>
					<p>
						The only case left is when $k=1$, where WLOG our pair is $(x,x+1)$ for some positive integer $x$. In this case, we use the following sequence of moves:
					</p>
					<p>
						$$(x,x+1)\rightarrow_1 (x+1,2x+2)\rightarrow_1 (x+2,2x+4)\rightarrow_2 (2x+4,4x+5)\rightarrow_2 \\ (4x+8,4x+6)\rightarrow_2 (8x+16,4x+7)\rightarrow_2 (16x+32,4x+8)\rightarrow_1 (16x+33,8x+16)\rightarrow_2\\ (32x+66,8x+17)\rightarrow_1 (32x+67,16x+34)\rightarrow_1 (32x+68,32x+68),$$
					</p>
					<p>
						which completes the solution. $\blacksquare$
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Comment.</strong> This problem is from the following thread on reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mathriddles/comments/2v6eaj/doubling_and_adding_1/">Doubling and adding 1</a>. We chose this problem because it has a very simple statement, but is actually quite hard. Also, every week we try to select a problem from an obscure source (i.e. not a well-known contest) as a way to introduce these sources to the reader, and to show that olympiad-style math problems can be found everywhere.
