            POTWs 2 Solutions
          </h1>
          <p>
						<em> 15 May 2018 </em>
					</p>
          <p>
						Here are the solutions to POTWs 2. Along with the solutions, we also give some comments and difficulty ratings $\beta$ in $[1,5]$, where POSN Camp level is 1-2, TMO level is 1-3, October Camp is around 2-4, and IMO is around 3-5.

						<strong>E2</strong> [@Konigsberg on AoPS] ($\beta = 1.4$)
						In a convex pentagon, show that we can choose $3$ diagonals such that their lengths can form a triangle.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Solution. </strong> Call the pentagon $A_1A_2A_3A_4A_5$. WLOG let $A_1A_3$ be the longest diagonal. We'll show that the diagonals $A_1A_3, A_1A_4, A_3A_5$ can form a triangle. Since $A_1A_3$ is the longest side, it's enough to prove that $A_3A_5+A_1A_4>A_1A_3$ - and this is true: if $T$ is the intersection of $A_1A_4$ and $A_3A_5$ then we have, by triangle inequality,
					</p>
					<p>
						$$A_1A_4+A_3A_5 > TA_1+TA_3 > A_1A_3. \quad \blacksquare$$
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Comment. </strong>The main idea is that we should choose the longest diagonal as one of the sides of our triangle, since it eliminates the need to bound two of the three triangle inequalities.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>M2 </strong>[China TST 2007 Quiz] ($\beta = 3.6$)
						Let $I$ be the incenter of triangle $ABC.$ Let $M,N$ be the midpoints of $AB,AC,$ respectively. Points $D,E$ lie on $AB,AC$ respectively such that $BD=CE=BC.$ The line perpendicular to $IM$ through $D$ intersects the line perpendicular to $IN$ through $E$ at $P.$ Prove that $AP\perp BC.$
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Solution. </strong>We begin with a remarkable lemma:
					</p>
					<p>
						<blockquote><strong>Lemma:</strong> For any four distinct points $A,B,C,D$ on a plane,
					</p>
					<p style="text-align:center">
								$AB\perp CD$ if and only if $AC^2+BD^2=AD^2+BC^2$.
					</p>
							</blockquote>
					<p>
						Since $M,N$ are the midpoints of $AB,AC$, it's clear that $MN\parallel AB$. So it's enough to prove $MN\perp BC$ instead. Applying the lemma, we need to show that
					</p>
					<p>
						$$AM^2+PN^2=AN^2+PM^2.$$
					</p>
					<p>
						Since $PD\perp IM$ and $PE\perp IN$, we have $PM^2=PI^2+MD^2-DI^2$ and $PN^2=PI^2+NE^2-IE^2$ by the lemma. Combining these two equations gives us $PM^2-PN^2=DM^2-EN^2+IE^2-ID^2$.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since that the incenter $I$ lie on the angle bisector of $\angle{ECB}$, which is the perpendicular bisector of $EB$, we have $IE=IB$. Similarly, $ID=IC$. Let $H$ be the projection of $I$ onto $BC$. We have
					</p>
					<p>
						$$IE^2-ID^2 =BH^2-CH^2=(\frac{BC+BA-AC}{2})^2-(\frac{BC+AC-AB}{2})^2.$$
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, from $DM=BD-BM=BC-\frac{AB}{2}$ and $EN=CE-CN=BC-\frac{AC}{2}$,
					</p>
					<p>
						$$\begin{aligned}PM^2-PN^2 & =DM^2-EN^2+IE^2-ID^2 \\
						& = (BC-\frac{AB}{2})^2-(BC-\frac{AC}{2})^2+(\frac{BC+BA-AC}{2})^2-(\frac{BC+AC-AB}{2})^2 \\
						& = (\frac{AC-AB}{2})(2BC-\frac{AB+AC}{2})+(AB-AC)(BC) \\
						& = (\frac{AB-AC}{2})(\frac{AB+AC}{2}) \\
						& = (\frac{AB}{2})^2-(\frac{AC}{2})^2 =AM^2-AN^2.
						\end{aligned}$$
					</p>
					<p>
						This implies $AM^2+PN^2=AN^2+PM^2$ as desired. $\blacksquare$
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Comment.</strong> This problem is actually rather hard. While the lemma is rather well-known (and not hard to prove), it is quite surprising that the lemma can be used all the way to a solution. Another important thing is to choose the correct points to make applying the lemma and "side-chasing" feasible. For example, it's possible to beautifully find $PM^2-PN^2$, so we used the lemma to show $MN\perp AP$ instead of $BC\perp AP$.

						<strong>H2</strong> [Google CodeJam 2011] ($\beta = 4.7$)
						Goro wants to sort a list of $n$ distinct numbers in an increasing order. In each round, Goro can fix some elements of the list. All non-fixed elements of the list will then be permuted randomly (with each permutation having equal probability.) Given $n$ and the initial list, determine the expected number of rounds Goro will need to sort the list, under Goro's best strategy.

						<strong>Solution. </strong>We would like to direct the reader towards the official solution <a href="https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/dashboard?c=975485#s=a&a=3">here.</a>

						<strong>Comment.</strong> The current trend in math olympiad problems seems to be towards more algorithmic problems - closer to competitive programming problems. This particular problem is a good example of problems in that style, so we chose to share it with our readers.
