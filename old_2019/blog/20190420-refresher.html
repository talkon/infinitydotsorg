						Evidently, this blog has been dead for almost a year. Here is a quick refresher of all the events in the past year. After last May, my life became a lot busier, and hence I didn't have time to update anything until January, when during a long weekend I moved us from the WordPress blog to this current site (which is completely made from scratch!). After that it was time for InfinityDots MO 3 and JMO, and hence this website was left as-is from January until now. From now on I will try to be more active (I've updated several pages today!) but to be honest I'm not sure if we'll ever get back to regular posting again.
