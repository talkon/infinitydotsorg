						About us
					</h1>
          <p>
						InfinityDots is a group of students sharing the hobby of proposing IMO-style math problems, based in Thailand. Most of us had been in the Thai TST Camp, and several of us are IMO medalists.

            Origin story
          </h2>
          <p>
            We first formed the group to participate in the AoPS-held <a href="https://www.artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1214545">Ultimate Step-by-Step (Problem) Olympiad</a>, then we realized that we all liked proposing problems. We first set out to propose our problems to our countryâ€™s national MO. (In our country, the TST Campers do not participate in the national MO.) However, that did not really work out so we decided to share our problems in a mock IMO, the first InfinityDots MO, instead. Since we received overwhemingly good feedback, InfinityDots MOs are now an annual thing (see <a href="https://www.infinitydots.org/mo.html">the InfinityDots MO page</a>), and that is what we are now known for.
